## Process Monitoring Middleware

The `processMonitoring` middleware provides real-time monitoring of the server's CPU and memory usage, as well as request processing time.

### Parameters

- `req`: The request object.
- `res`: The response object.
- `next`: The next middleware function in the request-response cycle.

### Description

The `processMonitoring` middleware logs the following information:

- Process start time, including request method and URL.
- Total number of requests processed.
- CPU usage (user and system times).
- Memory usage (total and free memory).
- Process finish time, including request method and URL.
- Elapsed time for request processing.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { processMonitoring } = require('apiutils.js');

const app = express();

// Middleware to monitor process
app.use(processMonitoring);

// Your routes and application logic here...

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Notes

- The middleware uses Node.js built-in modules `os` and `perf_hooks` to gather system and performance metrics.
- The monitoring interval is set to every 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds) by default, but this can be adjusted as needed.
- Ensure to place the `processMonitoring` middleware before your route handlers to monitor each incoming request.
