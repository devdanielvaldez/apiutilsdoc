## Response Compression Middleware

The `compressResponse` middleware compresses the response body using Gzip compression if the client supports it.

### Parameters

- `req`: The request object.
- `res`: The response object.
- `next`: The next middleware function in the request-response cycle.

### Description

The `compressResponse` middleware checks if the client accepts Gzip encoding. If accepted, it sets the `Content-Encoding` header to `gzip` and compresses the response body using Gzip compression.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { compressResponse } = require('apiutils.js');

const app = express();

// Middleware to compress response
app.use(compressResponse);

// Your routes and application logic here...

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Notes

- Ensure to place the `compressResponse` middleware before your route handlers to compress outgoing responses.
- Gzip compression can significantly reduce the size of the response body, improving network performance and reducing bandwidth usage for clients that support it.
