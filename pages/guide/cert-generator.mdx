### Certificate Generator

The `generateCert` module provides a function for generating RSA key pairs and saving them as certificate files. These certificates are essential for signing authentication tokens, ensuring secure communication between the server and clients.

#### Features

- **RSA Key Pair Generation**: Generates RSA key pairs with a modulus length of 4096 bits for enhanced security.
- **Certificate File Creation**: Saves the generated private and public keys as certificate files in the specified directory.
- **Directory Verification**: Checks if the target directory exists and creates it if not.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative console messages and returns an object indicating the success of the certificate generation process.

#### Usage

```javascript
const { generateCert } = require('apiutils.js');

try {
  const result = generateCertificate();
  console.log(result.msg);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error generating certificate:', error);
}
```

#### Return Value

- If the certificate generation is successful, returns an object with the message `"Certificate generated successfully at [certPath]"` and `ok: true`.
- If the certificate already exists, returns a message indicating that the certificate already exists at the specified path.
- If any error occurs during the certificate generation process, throws an error with a descriptive message.

#### Certificate Usage

The generated RSA key pair can be used for signing authentication tokens, ensuring secure and tamper-proof communication between the server and clients. The private key is used to sign the tokens, while the public key is used to verify their authenticity.

#### Certificate Files

The generated certificate consists of two files:
- `cert.pem`: Contains the private key.
- `cert.pem.pub`: Contains the public key.
