## Requirements

Make sure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. You can check your Node.js version using the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

Example output:
```
v20.10.0
```

Download Node.js from its [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

It is recommended to have Git installed for proper functionality. If you are using Linux or macOS, you probably already have Git installed by default. You can check your Git version using the following command:

```bash
git -v
```

Example output:
```
git version XXXX
```
